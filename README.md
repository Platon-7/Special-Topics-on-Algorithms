# Special-Topics-on-Algorithms

These two projects are part of the 4th year's course Special Topics on Algorithms that includes:

- Algorithms for theoretical number related problems and applications in cryptography, repeated squaring, Euclid's algorithm for finding the maximum common divisor, 
modulo arithmetic, primality testing, RSA and ElGamal cryptosystems.
- Average complexity and randomized algorithms: quicksort, ranking statistics, binary tree analysis, hashing. Amortized complexity: Union-Find, splay trees.
- Dynamic programming, NP-Completeness and reductions, combinatorial optimization problems: clique, independent set, vertex cover, set cover, Hamilton path and cycle,
TSP, 3-D matching, subset sum, knapsack, partition, bin-packing.
- Approximation algorithms: constant factor approximation algorithms, applications on vertex cover, applications on TSP and TSP under triangular inequality, scheduling
problems, randomized approximation algorithms.
- Approximation schemes (PTAS and FPTAS).
- Linear programming and integer linear programming.
- Max flow and bipartite matching problems. Complementary slackness, primal-dual theory of integer programming. Use of linear programming for designing approximation
algorithms (LP-Rounding and primal dual methods).
